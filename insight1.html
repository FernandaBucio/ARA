    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>Women’s brain health is not a niche issue — it affects more than half of the world’s population. Yet, neuroscience has historically sidelined women’s brains, treating hormonal changes as “confounds” rather than opportunities for discovery. This has slowed progress in research, funding, and clinical care.</p>

      <h2>Hormonal transitions as windows into plasticity</h2>
      <p>Puberty, pregnancy, the menstrual cycle, and menopause are often framed as “risk periods.” While these phases do bring vulnerability — for mood disorders, cognitive shifts, or Alzheimer’s disease (where women make up nearly two-thirds of cases) — they also reveal something deeper: the brain’s extraordinary ability to reorganize itself. These transitions are <strong>natural experiments in brain plasticity</strong>, showing how adaptable the adult brain truly is.</p>

      <h2>Key findings from the article</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Ovarian hormones are powerful neuromodulators</strong>: Estradiol can rapidly reshape hippocampal circuits, regulate immune cells (microglia), and influence neuroinflammation linked to Alzheimer’s.</li>
        <li><strong>Pregnancy remodels the brain</strong>: MRI studies show long-lasting changes in areas for social cognition and attachment — adaptations for maternal behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>The menstrual cycle is not “noise”</strong>: It drives reversible molecular and structural changes in the hippocampus, linked to memory and mood.</li>
        <li><strong>Contraceptives impact brain networks</strong>: With 150M+ users, oral contraceptives alter connectivity in emotional circuits — but research is still scarce.</li>
        <li><strong>Menopause = opportunity</strong>: Rising estradiol in midlife correlates with stronger brain networks and memory resilience, reframing menopause as neuroadaptive, not just decline.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why this matters for the future</h2>
      <p>By centering women’s brain health, science can be more equitable <em>and</em> more rigorous. Recognizing sex and hormonal states as key variables will improve treatments for conditions like Alzheimer’s and support precision medicine that actually fits diverse brains.</p>

      <p class="cta-line">✨ Brain science that includes women isn’t just equity — it’s smarter, stronger, and better for everyone.</p>
